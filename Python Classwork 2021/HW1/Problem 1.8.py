# Brief Description: Prints area and perimeter of a circle.

# assign a value to radius
radius = 5.5  # radius is now equal to 5.5

# Compute Area // note ** followed by number is basically 5.5^x
area = radius ** 2 * 3.14159

# Display Result Area
print("The area for the given radius of:", radius, " is: ", area)
