        <h3>Chosen Major and Minors</h3>
            <p>I went to Metropolitan Community College in Longview for two years and ended up graduating with an associates degree in arts.</p>
            <p>After graduating I transferred to UCMO and have chosen to major in <strong>Information Technology</strong> with minors in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Cyber-security</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I enjoy playing video games in my free-time. Recently I've been playing <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> and some <em>Lethal Company</em>. I'm looking forward to the DLC for Elden Ring since that's been in development a while.</p>
            <p>I like to build computers in my free-time as well as just mess around with the technology I have at my house. I've always enjoyed messing with old computers and stuff.</p>

    <h3>What is a dwarf?</h3>
    <figure id="whatDwarf">
        <blockquote>
            <strong><code>&le;Dwarves&ge;</code></strong> are a race of humanoid type that generally have study builds and are generally short. They can have lifespans similar or longer than humans. They are often seen with a variety of long beards. <br><br> Dwarves live in places like mountain cities and underground caverns. Generally speaking they are known for being skilled miners and craftsmen in fields like metalworking. They highly value their craftsmanship and their goods are highly sought after.

            <h3>Dwarves in games</h3>
            <p>In games dwarves are generally depicted as strong skilled warriors that are good at mining as well as both stone and metalworking.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Their wisdom score is increased by 1 point and their health max increases by 1 each level.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Mountain Dwarf</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their strength score is increased by 2 points and they're able to use light and medium armor well.</li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>According to rpgbot.net "dwarves are one of the best races in the Playerâ€™s Handbook. Their ability score increases are good, and their other racial traits make them durable and flexible enough to succeed in several classes."</p>
